## General info
This project was created to detect circular objects on oil images taken from a microscope. It mainly uses the circular Hough transform (imfindcircles).
In case the detected circle is inside a larger one, the program uses the function similar_center to eliminate the smaller one.

## Technologies
The project was developed in MATLAB
